## School_District_Analysis

### Purpose of Analysis: 
The school board has found evidence of dishonesty with math and reading scores of 9th graders at Thomas High School. Maria has done the
analysis and reporting on Thomas High School math and reading scores. She first did a district level analysis that included the tampered data. Next she replaced math and reading scores of only Thomas High School with NaNs to see how it impacted the overall analysis.

### Results:
* How is the district summary affected?
  Before replacing the reading and math scores with NaNs, the overall passing percentage for 15 schools was 65.17%
